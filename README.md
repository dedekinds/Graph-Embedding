# Graph-Embedding


These are the homeworks of Advance Machine Learning course in Tsinghua University(2018spring). Here, I implemented four network embedding algorithms(deepwalk, node2vec, TADW ,LINE) for two datasets(Cora, Tencent Weibo).


# dataset
* Cora (citation dataset)
* Tencent Weibo (following network)

# Usage
If you can not run the code through the following commad, you can use python IDE(such as Spyder) to run my code.
## deepwalk
```
python hw2_deepwalk.py
```
## node2vec
```
python hw2_node2vec.py
```
## LINE
```
python hw2_line.py
```
## TADW
```
python data_utils_cora.py
python hw2_TADW.py
```
